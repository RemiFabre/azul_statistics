# Azul

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Azul board game, implemented in Python.

This implementation is a port of a [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) implementation of Azul written
for a school project.

Note that:

* This implementation lacks documentation. If needed, they can be requested by a PR.
* Python used in this project is a bit awkward. This is due to direct translation of the original implementation.

## Playing

Simply run `main.py` to play the game.
