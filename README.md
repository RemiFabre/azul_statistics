# Azul

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Azul board game, implemented in Python.

This implementation is a port of a [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) implementation of Azul written
for a school project.

The purpose of this repository is to allow people experiment with Azul by writing AIs and using
Python's AI/ML libraries.
